## About

<Grid container spacing={2}>
  <Grid item xs={12} md={6}>
  <Typography paragraph>Hi, I'm <strong>Seb Wilgosz</strong>, and I run <a href='https://hanamimastery.com'>HanamiMastery</a> to help you get into <a href='https://hanamirb.org/'>Hanami framework</a> as easily as possible.</Typography>


  <Typography paragraph>Among the others, I am an author of <a href='https://www.udemy.com/course/ruby-on-rails-api-the-complete-guide/' target='_blank'>Rails API course</a> on Udemy and <a href='https://driggl.com' target='_blank'>Driggl blog</a>.</Typography>

:::important Our Mission
Make **Open-Source** projects **an attractive way for full-time jobs**!
:::

<br />

**I strongly believe that great community projects should get more support and financial stability**. Unfortuantely, most of amazing people who create great libraries and projects, need to work during nights and over the weekends **to make OUR lives better**.

To make things worse, creating a great OpenSource project require great technical capabilities, while monetising it is related to possesing decent MARKETING skills.

**Those two usually don't play well together**, which makes great open source maintainers and contributors to suffer for working for free.

[HanamiMastery](https://hanamimastery.com) is a first step, to improve on that field.

### Rules

This project is driven by a few simple rules.

- **10% (At least) of all income generated by this project and activity goes to support Hanami development since day one**.
- This includes Github sponsoring of my account, Youtube Channel, Blog monetization, income from affiliates, my premium products (courses, subscription) and so on. Just everything related to Hanami Mastery income.
- As soon as the Hanami 2.0 is released, we'll publish at least one episode per week.
- The evolving list of activities and Initiatives I'm running atm is placed on the [collaboartion page](/collaboration)
